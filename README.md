## RevolvingBox Component (Scroll-based Interaction)

### Overview:
The **RevolvingBox** component is a scroll-triggered element that revolves or rotates as the user scrolls through the page. This interaction can be used to create visually engaging effects, making the UI more dynamic and interactive.

### Features:
- Rotates on scroll: The box will rotate based on the scroll position, giving the illusion of a 3D effect.
- Customizable speed and angle: Easily modify the rotation speed and angle to suit the design needs.

### Usage:
```jsx
import RevolvingBox from './RevolvingBox';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <RevolvingBox />
  </div>
);
```

## FoldingBoxes Component (Interactive Folding Sections)

### Overview:
The **FoldingBoxes** component allows you to create collapsible sections that can be folded and unfolded by the user. This is perfect for displaying content in a compact, interactive way.

### Features:
- Click-to-toggle functionality: Each box can be clicked to toggle between folded and unfolded states.
- Smooth animations: The folding and unfolding actions are animated to enhance the user experience.

### Usage:
```jsx
import FoldingBoxes from './FoldingBoxes';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <FoldingBoxes />
  </div>
);
```

## Footer Component (Scroll-triggered Preloader)

### Overview:
The **Footer** component includes a scroll-triggered preloader that is activated when the user reaches the bottom of the page. This component can be used to provide users with visual feedback while waiting for content to load.

### Features:
- Scroll-based activation: The preloader is shown when the user scrolls to the footer, providing a seamless experience.
- Customizable loader: You can customize the appearance of the loader, such as its color and size.

### Usage:
```jsx
import Footer from './Footer';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Footer />
  </div>
);
```
