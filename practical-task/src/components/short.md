### **Question 1: Scroll-Triggered Animation Sequence**

**Situation:**  
Your startupâ€™s homepage requires a complex scroll-triggered animation sequence involving multiple SVG animations, layered interactions, and dynamic data visualizations. Performance and scalability are key to delivering a seamless user experience, especially under tight deadlines.

**Task:**  
To design and implement an efficient scroll-triggered animation sequence with minimal CPU/GPU usage, ensuring responsiveness across devices, while keeping the codebase maintainable and scalable.

**Action:**

1. **Framework and Tools:** Used lightweight libraries like [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for smooth animations and [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/) for scroll-based triggers. These tools are optimized for high performance and provide out-of-the-box support for SVG animations.
2. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - Reduced DOM updates by combining animations into a single timeline and reusing keyframes.
   - Used requestAnimationFrame for animations to synchronize with browser rendering cycles.
   - Leveraged GPU-accelerated properties like `transform` instead of `top` or `left`.
   - Minimized SVG size by using vector optimization tools like SVGO.
3. **Responsive Design:** Tested across devices and used media queries to adjust animation complexity for lower-end devices.
4. **Profiling and Testing:** Used browser developer tools (Performance tab) and tools like Lighthouse to profile frame rates, scripting time, and animation performance. Addressed bottlenecks by deferring non-critical animations and lazy-loading assets.

**Result:**  
Delivered a visually stunning, scroll-triggered animation that achieved over 60 FPS performance on most devices. The codebase was modular and easy to maintain, meeting both short deadlines and long-term scalability needs.

### **Question 2: Scaling Node.js Application**

**Situation:**  
The Node.js/Express application is experiencing massive traffic spikes during special sale events, causing slow responses and occasional timeouts.

**Task:**  
Diagnose the current performance bottlenecks, scale the backend effectively, and plan for resilience against future traffic spikes.

**Action:**

1. **Diagnosis:**
   - Monitored performance using tools like [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) and [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
   - Identified bottlenecks in database queries, middleware processing, and resource-intensive routes.
2. **Scaling Strategy:**
   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Added more instances of the app using a load balancer (e.g., NGINX) to distribute traffic.
   - **Vertical Scaling:** Upgraded server resources (CPU, RAM) temporarily during peak traffic.
   - Implemented caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data and responses.
   - Used message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) to offload non-critical tasks like email notifications.
3. **Future Planning:**
   - Migrated static assets to a CDN for faster delivery.
   - Adopted auto-scaling solutions on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
4. **Testing:** Conducted load testing using tools like [k6](https://k6.io/) and simulated peak traffic scenarios to ensure the system could handle spikes.

**Result:**  
Improved system response times by 50%, reduced timeouts to near-zero during peak events, and built a scalable infrastructure that can adapt to unpredictable traffic spikes.

### **Question 3: Integrating AI Tools with Poorly Documented API**

**Situation:**  
You need to develop a complex feature while integrating with a poorly documented and frequently changing third-party API, leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT.

**Task:**  
To deliver a reliable solution under evolving requirements while maintaining code quality and avoiding technical debt.

**Action:**

1. **Using AI Tools:**
   - Used AI to generate boilerplate code and explore API endpoints quickly based on partial documentation.
   - Verified AI-generated code against existing functionality and manually tested API responses.
2. **Handling Uncertainty:**
   - Created an abstraction layer to isolate direct API calls, making future updates easier.
   - Added schema validation (e.g., using Yup or Joi) to handle inconsistent data structures dynamically.
   - Collaborated with the API provider to clarify undocumented behavior and maintained a detailed internal reference.
3. **Maintaining Quality:**
   - Enforced rigorous code reviews and wrote automated tests to verify critical workflows.
   - Used tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style.
   - Documented assumptions and potential issues to ensure smooth handovers.

**Result:**  
Delivered a robust, maintainable feature that met evolving requirements. The abstraction layer minimized rework due to API changes, and reliance on AI improved productivity without introducing significant technical debt.

### **Question 4: Modernizing Legacy Node.js Application**

**Situation:**  
You inherited a tightly coupled, poorly documented monolithic Node.js application with outdated libraries. The goal was to modernize it while enabling ongoing feature development.

**Task:**  
To introduce a modular or microservices architecture, improve maintainability, and ensure backward compatibility during the transformation.

**Action:**

1. **Phased Refactoring:**
   - Identified critical modules (e.g., authentication, payment) to refactor first using dependency mapping.
   - Extracted these modules into separate services while maintaining backward-compatible APIs.
2. **Modernization:**
   - Updated libraries incrementally, focusing on security-critical dependencies.
   - Introduced TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
3. **Continuous Deployment:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
   - Used feature flags to roll out changes gradually and mitigate risks.
4. **Team Alignment:**
   - Conducted regular knowledge-sharing sessions to align the team.
   - Used project management tools (e.g., Jira) to track progress and dependencies.

**Result:**  
The application evolved into a modular architecture with improved maintainability, scalability, and security. This transition enabled uninterrupted feature development while reducing technical debt and improving team productivity.
